Background Information:

Installs Service Pack 6 for Visual Basic 6.0 provides the latest updates to Visual Basic 6.0. It is recommended
for all users of Visual Basic 6.0. Applications and controls written in Visual Basic 6 require the VB6 SP6 Redistributable Package
to be installed on the computer where the application or control runs. The Visual Basic 6 SP6 installation package is available
as a stand-alone executable file, VB6.0-KB290887-X86.exe. When this dependency module is included in your setup, it installs
Visual Basic 6 SP6 if needed.
